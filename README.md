# Object-Detection

Object detection using PyTorch. 

Detection is done using Pretrained models availble with pytorch as well as by coding models from scratch (YOLO), as well as finetuning on a different dataset.
Codes for all three are availble in the above folders.

Another model is availble which performs face detection using the pytorch implementation of the MTCNN network. Once face is detected multiple algorithms like DeepFace can be used for recognition. Smile detection is another use case that can be done once the face is detected.
